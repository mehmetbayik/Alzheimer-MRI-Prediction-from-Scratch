# EEE485 Statistical Learning and Data Analytics

Project implementations done for EEE485 course, Bilkent University.

## Coverage of the repository

In this repository, you can find my project that includes implementations of the following algorithms:

### Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression implemented without using any ML libraries.

I plan to use Logistic Regression method for first algorithm in this project. It is not the best method but still it will be good for comparison after extracting data from images.

### Support Vector Machine

Support Vector Machine implemented without using any ML libraries.

Support vector machines can be powerful tool for multiclass classification. Training time can be higher than other methods, but it can get more accurate results when compared to Regression.

### Neural Network

Neural Network implemented without using any ML libraries.

Neural networks will be the third algorithm that will use. In conclusion, I think that this method will be best method when we compare their accuracies and time efficiency. Writing Neural Network from scratch might be challenging. If I can, I will use CNN or ResNet, but I am not sure if I can write these algorithms from scratch.

## Dataset

In this project, Alzheimer MRI dataset used from Kaggle. You can find the dataset from the following link:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar413/alzheimer-mri-dataset

In this Kaggle dataset, there are total of 6400 images collected from several websites, hospitals, public repositories. The dataset includes 4 classes of 128x128 preprocessed images. These classes are: Non Demented, Very Mild Demented, Mild Demented, Moderate Demented and there are 3200, 2240, 896, 64 images in these classes respectively.
